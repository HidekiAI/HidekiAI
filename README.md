- 👋 Hi, I’m @HidekiAI
- 👀 I’m interested in writing/working on projects that are somewhat useless (useful TO ME, but not too useful to you) but FUN TO ME...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning rust and F#...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any video game stuff (been a video game programmer professionally since April-1989)...
- 📫 How to reach me ...
